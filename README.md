# PasswordAnalyzer
This Java program checks the strength of a password based on several criteria: a minimum length of 12 characters, at least 3 uppercase letters, at least 2 special characters, and 3 digits. It also detects common weak passwords like "password" or "123456." The program classifies passwords as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong."
